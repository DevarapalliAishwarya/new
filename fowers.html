        <p align="center"><font color="blue">The hunter-gatherer ancestors of modern humans<br> surely noticed that flowers gave rise to fruits that could be eaten. 
            Because flowers signaled an<br> anticipated harvest, it has been suggested that these early humans instinctively considered
             flowers attractive, an instinct that modern humans may also have. 
            Many modern cultures consider flowers attractive, and scholars have been fascinated with flowers for millennia</font>.</p>
